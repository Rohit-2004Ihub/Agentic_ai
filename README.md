# Agentic_ai### 📘 README - Agentic AI-Powered Case Study Generator

---

##  Overview

**Agentic AI-Powered Case Study Generator** is a full-stack application that allows users to upload `.docx` project documents and automatically generates:

* A structured project summary
* A detailed case study
* A refined version using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
* Visual aid recommendations (like flowcharts and diagrams)
* Pitch feedback for presenting to investors or evaluators

The system uses **LangChain**, **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, and a **multi-agent architecture** powered by **LangGraph**. It is built with a **Django backend** and a **React frontend**, and designed for students, researchers, and startups preparing professional case documentation and presentations.

##  How It Works

1. **Upload Document**: User uploads a `.docx` file via the frontend.
2. **Django API**: Receives file → extracts text → triggers LangGraph agent flow.
3. **LangGraph Execution**:

   * `ProjectExtractor` identifies key summary points.
   * `CaseStudyComposer` writes a coherent narrative.
   * `RAGRefiner` enhances the story using embedded context and FAISS vector search.
   * `VisualAidRecommender` suggests diagrams and optionally Mermaid.js flowcharts.
   * `PitchSimulator` critiques the pitch and gives improvement tips.
4. **Frontend Display**: React app shows each agent’s output with animations and formatting.

##  Key Technologies

* **Django** — RESTful backend for file handling and agent execution
* **React.js** — Dynamic frontend UI
* **LangChain + LangGraph** — Multi-agent orchestration
* **Gemini 1.5 Flash** — LLM for reasoning, writing, and simulation
* **FAISS + RAG** — For document-aware contextual refinement
* **Mermaid.js** — Visual diagram output

##  Setup Instructions

### Backend (Django)


cd case_study_ai/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend (React)


cd case_study_ai/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### .env

Store your Google Gemini API key in a `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

##  Example Output

```
Structured Summary:
"This project developed a smart waste management solution using IoT and AI..."

Case Study:
"During a pilot run across 3 cities, bin overflow dropped by 90%..."

RAG-Enhanced Case Study:
"Compared to similar IoT systems from 2023, our design showed..."

Visual Aid Suggestions:
- Architecture Diagram
- Flowchart (Mermaid)
- Comparative Analytics Chart

Pitch Feedback:
"Highlight ROI and unique selling point better. Include estimated market reach."
```

##  RAG Implementation

* All case study content is embedded using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings`.
* FAISS is used for fast nearest neighbor search.
* The `RAGRefiner` agent retrieves chunks relevant to the case study and enhances clarity, accuracy, and benchmarking with external knowledge.
